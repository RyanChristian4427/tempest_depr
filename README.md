# Tempest [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/RyanChristian4427/tempest.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/RyanChristian4427/tempest)
> Webmail API server and client

Tempest will eventually be a webmail client that will not be unlike other webmail systems like Gmail. I had a desire to work with Rust, as well as work more with Vue, so I thought that this would make a great project.  

## Getting Started

Instructions for running both the API server and the client can be found in the READMEs in the respective sub-directories.

## Deployment

Add additional notes about how to deploy this on a live system
