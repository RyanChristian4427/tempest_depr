> Webmail API server and client

Tempest will eventually be a webmail client with a custom build email server.

This, however, is a long way off in the future. I quickly lost the time I had planned on using to build this due to my studies and I have not been able to find the time since. There's not much here as of now, but maybe in the future I'll be able to pick this up and do it justice. 

## Getting Started

Instructions for running both the API server and the client can be found in the READMEs in the respective sub-directories.

## Built With

* [Rocket](https://rocket.rs/) - The web framework used to build the API
  * [Diesel](https://diesel.rs/) - ORM and Query Builder for Rust
  * [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/) - RDBMS used
  * [Cargo](https://crates.io/) - Server dependency management
